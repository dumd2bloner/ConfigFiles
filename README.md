# ConfigFiles
This is just a placeholder for the configuration files in my environment.
It still is a work in progress so nothing is expected to work for now.

Also note that before pushing I had to remove some parts that were specific to my daytime job which will further reduce the probability of thay working

Note that I have shamefully copied some files. I will have those files update directly when I get some time. Sorry about that
